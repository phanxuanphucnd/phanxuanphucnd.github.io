One of the major defects of Seq2Seq models is that it can't process
words in parallel. For a large corpus of text, this increases the time
spent translating the text. CNNs can help us solve this problem. In this
paper: "[Language Modeling with Gated Convolutional
Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08083v3.pdf)", proposed by FAIR
(Facebook AI Research) in 2016.
